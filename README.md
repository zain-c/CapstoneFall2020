Technical Homework 3: Make It Yours

Exercise 3.1: A Personal Touch (12 points)
Do you have a personal website? If you don’t, you should. Buying a domain
these days is cheap and building out a website that you put some love into can
be fun. Using Bootstrap, I put together a pretty simple “portfolio” style website.

Homework 3 Assignment Tasks – Development Tasks (HTML and Bootstrap Edits)
● Add at least 2 completely new sections or pages
● Add your own font (Try Using Google Fonts CDN)
● Add your own icons (Try Using Font Awesome CDN)
● Add your own photos (Try Using Free Stock Photos - https://unsplash.com/)
● Personalize it! Add your name and some fun things about yourself
● Try out at least 2 Bootstrap components other than what is on the template
● Use the utility classes as much as possible

Git Repo Prep
Make sure you have Git installed ( https://git-scm.com/ ) before getting started.
You are welcome to use either Git Bash or Git GUI to run your commands. They’re both
valid options, but it’s worth noting that it is far better to use Git Bash while you’re still
learning so that you understand all the steps that are occurring.
Using a Git GUI Tool
A Quick Note About GitHub Desktop
GitHub has developed a truly incredible application called GitHub
Desktop. It integrates perfectly with GitHub so you won’t have to worry about running
any commands yourself. It streamlines the entire process for you. While you are
learning the basics of Git, using GitHub Desktop will likely hurt you in the long run.
Unfortunately, GitHub Desktop only works for GitHub. Many companies also use
Bitbucket or other repository solutions that this software can’t interact with. It’s
important that you stick to basic Git tools to learn what you can about Git, and then
when you’re comfortable with it (ie. In Capstone 2) you can use it to make your life
easier.
Assignment Setup Step 1 – Git Requirement to Setup Your New Website Repo
First, create a GitHub account if you don’t already have one. Here’s the link:
https://github.com/join
Next, clone the repository at this URL:
git clone <repository URL here – Will we create one?>
Checkout a new branch using the format lastname-firstname:
git checkout -b smith-john

Assignment Setup Step 2 – Review Bootstrap Starter Template (Repo you just cloned)
If you open the index.html file you now have, you should see the simple
portfolio site. Your task for this assignment is to personalize it. Add some color,
images, or even completely change the whole thing. It’s written in some pretty simple
Bootstrap, and you should be completely prepared at this point to tinker around with
it and make it your own.

After all of your coding is done -Add, Commit and Push Your New Website Code to Repo
When you’ve finished up, commit your changes and push them to your branch
for grading. If you like what you’ve come up with, you now have code that can be used
for a personal website!
